            <h1>scan GRETIL</h1>

            <p>I'm inviting anyone who's interested to help improve the world's stock of digital Sanskrit texts
            by using <b>skrutable</b>'s <i>en-masse</i> meter-identification functionality
            to help sniff out and fix textual problems
            and to establish a meter dataset for reference and benchmarking purposes.</p>

            <h2>how-to</h2>

            <p>Analyzing the meter of a whole metrical text is a fun and effective way to identify textual problems in need of fixing.
            Obviously you need to already know a bit about Sanskrit and Sanskrit meter, and you have to start with decently good data.
            But assuming those, then it's only a matter of having the right tools and patiently applying yourself.
            Here's one way to go about it.</p>

            <p><b>Step 1</b>: Identify a text you'd like to work on. Go find it online.
            GRETIL texts include some of the highest-quality ones around and are relatively easy to work with, so they're a good starting point.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 2em;">For example: The Bhagavadg카t훮 (BhG) (<a href="http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/1_sanskr/2_epic/mbh/ext/bhgce__u.htm">raw GRETIL file</a>)</p>
            <p>Step 2: Clean up the file so that it is a text file with exactly one (potential) whole verse per line. (Note: For now, no half-verses. I'll fix that soon.)</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 2em;">For example:
            <a href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/skrutable/files/home/skrutable/mysite/scanGRETIL/BhG_input_cleaned.txt">BhG input cleaned</a></p>
            <p>Step 3: Submit the cleaned file to <b>skrutable</b>'s <i>en-masse</i> meter identifier using the "whole file" button.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 2em;">For example:
            <a href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/skrutable/files/home/skrutable/mysite/scanGRETIL/BhG_output_raw.txt">BhG raw output</a>
            &gt;&gt;
            <a href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/skrutable/files/home/skrutable/mysite/scanGRETIL/BhG_output_cleaned.txt">BhG output cleaned</a>
            </p>
            <p>Step 4: Read through the results, looking for irregularities (use regexes to search more effectively). Where there's a metrical problem, there's usually a textual problem.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 2em;">For example: (currently working on separating interesting BhG issues from <b>skrutable</b>'s failure on upaj훮ti ...) </p>
            <p>Step 5: If you can, try to come up with solutions for the textual problems, one-by-one.
                <ul>
                    <li>Is the problem in the digital text itself?</li>
                    <li>Or in the edition the digital text is based on?</li>
                    <li>Is it <b>skrutable</b>? (entirely likely, since there are still meters I have yet to teach it to recognize properly, e.g., upaj훮ti)</li>
                    <li>Something even more interesting?</li>
                </ul>
            Once you're confident about your results, send the results over to me.
            I'll post the <a href="./scanGRETILresults">cumulative results here</a>.
            This takes time, patience, and expert knowledge,
            so there's no way one person could ever do it properly all on their own!</p>

            <p>And if you were able to make improvements to the text, send it on back to GRETIL. (I'm happy to help you do that, if need be.)</p>

            Intrigued? Flabbergasted? <a href="https://uni-leipzig1.academia.edu/TylerNeill">Write me!</a> We'll talk.</p>
