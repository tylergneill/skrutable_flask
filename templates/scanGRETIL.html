            <h1>scan GRETIL</h1>

            <p>One way you can help improve the world's stock of digital Sanskrit data
            is to use <b>skrutable</b>'s whole-file meter identification 
            to detect certain kinds of textual problems
            and also to contribute toward an open meter dataset for reference and benchmarking purposes.</p>

            <h2>how-to</h2>

            <p>Your results are going to be only as good as your input data,
            and in order to be able to do anything with your results,
            you're obviously going to need to already know at least a little bit about Sanskrit language and meter (aka prosody).
            However, assuming those two things, then it's really only a matter of having a good tool, interest, and some patience.
            Here's one way to go about it.</p>

            <p><b>Step 1</b>: Identify a text you'd like to work on. Go find it online.
            GRETIL texts include some of the highest-quality ones around and are relatively easy to work with, so they're a good starting point.
            For example: the Bhagavadgītā (BhG) <a href="http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/1_sanskr/2_epic/mbh/ext/bhgce__u.htm">raw GRETIL file</a></p>
            <p><b>Step 2</b>: Clean up the file so that it is a text file with exactly one (potential) whole verse per line. Half an anuṣṭubh śloka is ok, too.
            For example:
            <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tylergneill/skrutable_front_end/main/assets/meter_analyses/BhG/BhG_input_cleaned.txt">BhG input cleaned</a></p>
            <p><b>Step 3</b>: Submit the cleaned file to <b>skrutable</b>'s meter identifier using the "whole file" button.
            <b>skrutable</b> is <i>really</i> fast, so the 700 verses of the Gītā won't take long at all:
            <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tylergneill/skrutable_front_end/main/assets/meter_analyses/BhG/BhG_output_raw.txt">BhG raw output</a> and 
            <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tylergneill/skrutable_front_end/main/assets/meter_analyses/BhG/BhG_output_cleaned.txt">BhG output cleaned</a>
            </p>
            <p><b>Step 4</b>: Now read through the results, looking for irregularities (you can use regexes to search more effectively). Where there's a metrical "problem", there just might be also a textual "problem" in need of fixing.</p>
            
            <p>As you might expect, though, the BhG is in pretty good shape, having received a lot of attention over the years.</p>

            <p>But consider for example the huge text of the Rāmāyaṇa:
            (<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tylergneill/skrutable_front_end/main/assets/meter_analyses/Ramayana/R_input_cleaned_(ram_1-7u_htm_Dec_2018_semicolons).htm">raw in</a> — Dec 2018 version with semicolons), (<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tylergneill/skrutable_front_end/main/assets/meter_analyses/Ramayana/R_input_cleaned.txt">clean in</a>), (<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tylergneill/skrutable_front_end/main/assets/meter_analyses/Ramayana/R_output_raw_none_lite_conditional.txt">raw out</a>), (<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tylergneill/skrutable_front_end/main/assets/meter_analyses/Ramayana/R_output_cleaned_none_lite_conditional.txt">clean out</a>), (<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tylergneill/skrutable_front_end/main/assets/meter_analyses/Ramayana/R_output_breakdown_and_problems.txt">breakdown and problems</a>).</p>

            <p>There one definitely finds some clear textual problems: hyper- or hypometrical lines, typos that result in different syllable weights, and so on. Just look for invalid ("asamīcīna") anuṣṭubhs and other verses with less than four valid ("yukta") pādas, as well as for verses that might be either one thing or another ("atha vā"). Also, the verse type "upajāti (triṣṭubh-jagatī-saṃkara)" can sometimes be genuine, but usually it's just a pāda gone wrong.</p>
            
            <p><b>Step 5</b>: Now, if you can, try to come up with solutions for the textual problems, or in other words, explanations for the interesting stuff that you find in your text.
                <ul>
                    <li>Is something wrong with the digital text?</li>
                    <li>Or with the edition (or editions) the digital text is based on?</li>
                    <li>Or is <b>skrutable</b> doing something wrong?</li>
                    <li>Or is maybe something even more interesting happening?</li>
                </ul>
            <p>

            <p>Then, if you want, share your results with me or others.
            I'll post <a href="./scanGRETILresults">cumulative results here</a>.
            This takes time, patience, and expert knowledge — preparing the data, scrutinizing each problem verse, and so on — so it definitely needs to be a team effort!</p>

            <p>And if you were able to make improvements to the text, you can send it on back to GRETIL
            or wherever else. I'm happy to help you do that, if need be.</p>
